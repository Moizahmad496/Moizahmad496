ðŸ”‘ Projects & Work Experience

- **Fidsor- QA Engineer (Current)** At Fidsor, I test and validate **Web** and** Mobile app applications** I perform User Acceptance Testing (UAT), use Microsoft planner , Google sheets and Jira for test management, and implement Postman and Cypress for API and automation testing. My work ensures product stability and a smooth user experience for customers.
 Saving testing time by **40%** by performing regression through Automation. Also building automation workflows using **n8n + AI** to overcome the daily basis repititive tasks.
  
- **Octaloop Technologies** - As a **Junior QA  Engineer**, I worked on the Test planning stratigies along collabrorating with the QA teams to ensure smooth dilivery of software applications. I  also work on n8n automation to overcome the daily basis manual workflows and transformed it into automated workflows that saved organization's time.
  Performed API and Performance tetsing using tools like Jmeter & Postman.

- **FlavorNow**- **Canadian Resturants and CMS Management Project** - As a QA Engineer, I collaborated closely with the team from the very beginning of the project, following a shift-left approach. From reviewing designs and requirements to validating each API, UI component, and overall application performance, I played an active role in ensuring quality at every stage â€” contributing to the successful delivery of the project.

-  **Parabank Banking Application Project** - As a QA Engineer, I designed and implemented automated test suites using Cypress, covering all UI, functional, and edge cases. I also integrated CI/CD pipelines to continuously monitor and identify issues before deployment, ensuring higher product stability. This automation reduced manual testing time by **40%** by streamlining and automating all **regression test suites**

- **RAG CHatbot to read Company Documents Project** -  Using the n8n automation tool, I designed and implemented a workflow for a client that automatically detects new file uploads on Google Drive. The workflow then fetches and processes the data, converting it into Pinecone vector store elements connected with a buffer memory. As a result, users can interactively chat with company documents, saving significant time by eliminating the need for lengthy readings and providing instant, context-based answers.
